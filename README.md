## Gourmet-Recipes

## Description

Gourmet-Recipes is a web application designed so the user can search recipes of their choosing. Exploring our culinary options to improve our cooking abilities was the main motivation behind designing this website. In this website the user will be able to view dishes that the developers have prepared, in order to search other recipes the user will need to login. If the user does not have a login, then the user will need to request a login. Once logged in the user will be able to search available recipes. 

## Features 

React
Okta login
React Components Styling
Edamam Api Search
Mongo Database
UUID Package

## Starting app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in the root directory, run the following command:
~~~
npm install
~~~

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder. After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

~~~
npm start
~~~

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.

## Usage 

In this website the user will be able to view dishes that the developers have prepared, in order to search other recipes the user will need to login. If the user does not have a login, then the user will need to request a login. Once logged in the user will be able to search available recipes.
